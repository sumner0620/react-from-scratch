# React from Scratch

This is just a simple React, Babel and Webpack starter configuration to get you up and running with your React app. I created this because I'm not a fan of using create-react-app if I can help it, as I find it best practice to keep your project and your code as lean as possible. Create-react-app tends to be a bit verbose and bloated for most simple apps, so this seemed like a good option.

## Getting started

To use this just clone the repo, open your command line, and `yarn install` or `npm install` to add all the dependencies.

## Yarn scripts

There are two scripts set up for you already, `build` and `start`. Use the package manager of your choice to run either of them, i.e.: `yarn build`. `build` is obviously for a production build, while `start` is to run your development project.
